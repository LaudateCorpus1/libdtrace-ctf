The following features and functions have not been tested since the Solaris era,
and thus are relatively likely to be broken.

Caveat emptor applies.

Untested features:

  - Labels, including parent labels and parent names in the CTF header
  - the ELF string table (CTF_STRTAB_1)
  - the function info section and symbol table handling: ctf_add_function(),
    ctf_func_info(), ctf_func_args(), ctf_lookup_by_symbol(), init_symtab(),
    sym_to_elf64(), ctf_nsyms, ctf_sxlate
  - ctf_add_type() of enums; ctf_enum_name() and ctf_enum_value()
  - declarator handling around the restrict qualifier
  - some codepaths to do with anonymous struct/union members
  - ctf_version() (which we can possibly drop? seems like it might be useful in
    future though)
  - reuse of integer/float variable names by bitfields (all dwarf2ctf's
    bitfields are unnamed types)
